# Privacy Policy for the app “DocToMind”

Last updated: December 2025

This privacy policy explains what personal data is processed when you use the app **DocToMind** and for which purposes.

DocToMind is operated by:

**Controller / Developer**  
Alice Laquerriere  
E-mail: alice.laquerriere@gmx.de

## 1. General Principles

DocToMind is a learning and productivity tool for medical texts.  
The app is designed to work primarily **on your device**, not on external servers.

- There is **no automatic upload** of your documents or content to external servers.  
- No third-party tracking or analytics services (e.g. Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics) are used.  
- No profiling in the sense of the GDPR is performed.

---

## 2. Data Processed in the App

### 2.1 Documents and Content

With DocToMind you can, for example:

- scan medical documents (e.g. letters, reports, notes)  
- perform OCR (text recognition)  
- generate summaries, learning cards and explanations  

Whether personal data is processed depends entirely on the documents that **you** choose to import into the app (for example, if real patient data is contained in a document).

These contents are:

- processed **locally on your device**  
- stored only inside the app or  
- stored in files/exports that you explicitly create (e.g. text export, Anki TSV).

There is **no automatic transfer** of these contents to the developer or to any third party.

You, as the user, are responsible for using the app in compliance with applicable data protection rules (e.g. anonymising patient data, following institutional policies).

---

### 2.2 Technical Data / App Functionality

To provide basic functionality, the app may locally process technical information such as:

- device type (iPhone / iPad – used internally for layout and display)  
- settings you choose within the app  

These data are used solely to provide the app’s features and are not transmitted to external servers.

The legal basis (where the GDPR applies) is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract / use of the app).

---
### 2.3 Camera

DocToMind uses the device camera only to scan documents that you explicitly choose to capture (e.g. medical letters, reports, notes or learning material). The images are processed locally on the device to perform OCR and generate text. They are not automatically uploaded to any external server by the app.

## 3. Contacting Support

If you contact support (for example by e-mail to **alice.laquerriere@gmx.de**), the personal data you provide will be processed, such as:

- your e-mail address  
- the content of your message  
- any error descriptions, screenshots or logs you choose to send  

These data are used solely to handle and respond to your request.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (responding to user requests in the context of app usage) and, where applicable, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in efficient communication).

**Important:**  
Please do **not** send real patient data or other highly sensitive data in support requests. Use anonymised or fictitious examples instead.

---

## 4. No Third-Party Services / No Data Sharing

DocToMind does **not** use:

- external analytics services  
- advertising networks or ad tracking  
- social media plugins  

No data is shared with third parties, unless:

- this is required by law, or  
- you explicitly consent to it.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- Data stored on your device (documents, summaries, learning cards, exports, etc.) are kept as long as you do not delete them yourself or remove the app.  
- Data from support requests (e.g. e-mails) are stored only as long as necessary to process your request, subject to statutory retention obligations.

---

## 6. Your Rights under the GDPR

Where the GDPR applies and personal data are processed, you have the following rights:

- Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)  
- Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)  
- Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)  
- Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)  
- Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)  
- Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)  
- Right to withdraw consent at any time with effect for the future (Art. 7(3) GDPR), where processing is based on consent  

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.

## 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time, for example if app features change or legal requirements are updated.
