📚 Evidence, AI & Citations

DocToMind uses on-device AI models to **summarise** and **restructure** medical texts.  
To comply with Apple guideline 1.4.1 *Safety: Physical Harm*, the app:

- avoids definitive diagnostic or therapeutic recommendations  
- labels AI-generated output as **non-binding, educational content**  
- encourages verification against original documents and guidelines  
- allows the user to review and edit all generated text  

Any medical information or terminology is based on established clinical usage and literature but **may be incomplete, outdated, or incorrect**. Always verify with original sources and current guidelines.

- is designed to work **locally on the device**  
- does **not** require an online account  
- does **not** automatically upload documents to external servers  
- stores processed text only within the app or in exports explicitly created by the user  

⚠️ Responsibility of the user:

- ensure that use of DocToMind complies with your local data protection rules (e.g. GDPR, Klinikrichtlinien)  
- avoid using real patient identifiers where this is not strictly necessary

If you have questions regarding privacy, please contact us via email.
